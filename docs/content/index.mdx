Welcome to the Agents at Scale Marketplace documentation. This marketplace provides a collection of services, agents, and tools for the [ARK platform](https://github.com/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark).

## What is the Marketplace?

The marketplace is a curated collection of:

- **Services**: Production-ready observability, storage, and infrastructure services
- **Agents**: Pre-built agents and agent templates
- **Tools**: Reusable tools and utilities for agent development
- **Projects**: Complete solution accelerators and reference implementations

## Available Services

Currently available services:

- **[Langfuse](./services/langfuse)** - Open Source LLM Application/Agent observability, evaluation, and prompt management
- **[Phoenix](./services/phoenix)** - AI/ML observability and evaluation platform with OpenTelemetry integration
