# Noah

Noah is the Agent who runs the Ark. Noah can answers questions on how Ark works, fix problems, create new agents, troubleshoot the system, or help you build agentic use cases.

## Examples

**Ark Basics**

```
"What is Ark, how does it work?"
"How can I create an agent, can you help me create one?"
```

**Troubleshooting Agents**

> Some of my agents aren't working - why?

**Kubernetes Cluster Management**

```
"Show me all pods in the cluster"
"What's the status of deployments in the ark-system namespace?"
"Describe the noah-mcp service"
"List all Helm releases"
"Show me the values for the langfuse release"
"What charts are available in the repository?"
```

## Requirements

- **Ark 0.1.50+**: Noah requires Ark version 0.1.50 or later due to MCP server path configuration changes
- For older Ark versions, set `mcpServer.path: ""` in your Helm values to disable explicit path configuration

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Using ARK CLI (Recommended):**
```bash
ark install marketplace/agents/noah
```

**Using DevSpace (for Development):**
```bash
cd agents/noah
devspace deploy
```

**Using Helm:**
```bash
cd agents/noah
helm install noah ./chart -n default
```

## Tools

Under the hood, Noah works because he has access to the Kubernetes APIs and some basic shell tools, such as `kubectl`, `helm`, `bash`, `argo`, `python` and so on.

Noah also has access to an "Ark Administration" MCP server that provides additional capabilities.

## Security Considerations

Noah has admin privileges within its namespace and can perform operations including:
- Deleting resources
- Modifying configurations
- Accessing secrets and sensitive data

## Uninstallation

**Using ARK CLI:**
```bash
ark uninstall marketplace/agents/noah
```

**Using DevSpace:**
```bash
cd agents/noah
devspace purge
```

**Using Helm:**
```bash
helm uninstall noah -n default
```
