    Risk assessment team that synthesizes all verification findings and generates final compliance reports.

    This team performs two critical final steps:

    1. Risk Assessor: Calculates comprehensive risk score (0-100) based on:
       - Geographic risk (jurisdiction, FATF status)
       - Industry/business risk
       - Ownership complexity
       - Sanctions and watchlist hits
       - PEP exposure levels
       - Adverse media findings
       - Transaction profile risk
       Determines Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements and monitoring levels.

    2. Compliance Reporter: Consolidates all findings into audit-ready KYC compliance report:
       - Executive summary with key findings
       - Complete verification history (documents, UBOs, screening, risk)
       - Onboarding recommendation (APPROVE/APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS/REJECT/ESCALATE)
       - Compliance requirements and monitoring plan
       - Full audit trail

    Use this team as the final step to generate customer onboarding decisions and compliance documentation.
