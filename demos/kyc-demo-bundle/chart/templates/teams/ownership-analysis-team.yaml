    Ownership analysis team that extracts Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) and key controllers.

    This team performs comprehensive corporate structure analysis:
    - Identifies all Ultimate Beneficial Owners (individuals owning ≥25% directly or indirectly)
    - Maps complete ownership structure and control chains
    - Extracts Board of Directors and C-level executives
    - Identifies all persons with significant control (PSCs)
    - Generates hierarchical ownership tree structure

    The output includes a JSON-formatted list of all individuals requiring sanctions and PEP screening.
